MACA
====

This repository contains code and documentation for what I did with the MACAV2-METDATA and METDATA datasets to make their data useful for Oklahoma EPSCoR research projects (and others) in the Cimarron and Kiamichi watershed study areas.

The Jupyter (formerly IPython) notebook [MACA_to_Envision_SWAT.ipynb](MACA_to_Envision_SWAT.ipynb) is the master document with the narrative of the entire process and all of the code.

An HTML export of the notebook is available at [MACA_to_Envision_SWAT.html](MACA_to_Envision_SWAT.html) for easy viewing in a browser and I've made a couple PDFs because the notebook and the HTML version aren't well-suited for printing ([PDF 1](doc/MACA_to_Envision_SWAT.pdf), [PDF 2](doc/MACA_to_Envision_SWAT_small_margins.pdf)).

Scripts used for data conversion are in the *dataset*\_Derived directories.
